# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.4]

### Changed
- Restructured repository into **projects**:
  - **`e2e/`** for UI/browser tests (moved `globalConfig` ‚Üí `e2e/globalConfig.ui.js`, `Timeouts.js`, pages & specs).
  - **`api/`** scaffold for future API tests.
- Updated `playwright.config.js` to define **projects** and point to `./e2e/tests` and `./api/tests`.
- Updated docs to show `--project=e2e|api` usage and new project tree.


---

## [2.2.3]
